# methods-meeting
A repository to show github

## General idea
1. Repository
- Per project
- Include everything
- README recommended (uses markdown)

2. Branching
- For working on different versions

3. Make and commit changes
- Git and Command line

4. Pull requests
- Collaborations
- Propose changes -> merge

5. Forking
- Contribute or use other project as a starting point

## Differences between public and private
- Our organization all public
- Own page can make private repositories and share with collaborators.
